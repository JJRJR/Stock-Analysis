# Module 2 Challenge
Stock Analysis Challenge

## Overview of Project
Steve wants to be able to us this code to not only look the current stocks listed, but to see all stocks including ones added later. Also, we need to refactor our solution code to loop through the same stock analysis data faster and more effecient. 

## Results
After refactoring the analysis we were able to see that 2017 stocks performed much better than 2018. ENPH and RUN were the only two stocks that showed gorwth in both 2017 and 2018 where as TERP showed a loss both years. DQ the original stock Steve's parents inquired about had a good year in 2017 however in 2018 it showed heavy losses. If I was recommending a stock based off our analysis it would be ENPH because it was the best perfomring stock overall the last 2 years.
